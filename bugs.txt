# BUGS
1. 2024-11-10 - array in map object states is still not updating 2nd and 3rd lists on each iteration.
    - Continue checking UpdateStateInfections function.
        - UPDATE: UpdateStateInfections is definitely the issue and not appending modified Person object to state.second[1] or [2],
                    or erasing value to be removed from state.second[0].
        - FIXED: In UpdateStateInfections: for (auto state : states) changed to for (auto& state : states).
                    & required to explicitly refer to lists by reference.

2. 2024-11-10 - string StateInfectionSummaryToString(pair<const string, array<list<Person>, 3>> &state)
    - Changed to: string StateInfectionSummaryToString(const pair<string, array<list<Person>, 3>> &state)

3. 2024-11-10 - Program wasn't pausing to let user read results.
    - Sleep timer implemented, thread & chrono used.

4. 2024-11-10 - Each iteration keeps using the same people names, recovery and deaths.
    - FIXED: See item 1 above. & fixed the iteration.

5. 2024-11-10 - Each iteration appends new Person to infection list, but previous Person object remains and gets updated again.
    - FIXED: See item 1 above. & removed previous Person from list and prevented additional update.

6. 2024-11-10 - UpdateHealthStatus doesn't provide a way for Person to remain infected.
    - FIXED: Recovery algorithm updated in UpdateHealthStatus.

7. 2024-11-10 - No function to add additional infections based on number of current infections.
    - Added loop in main to handle additional infection to infected list.

8. 2024-11-10 - Infection list in main seems to be looping infinitely after first iteration.
    - FIXED: Note to self: DON'T USE i < list.size() when using the loop to push values into said list.

9. 2024-11-10 - Program not adding more than one infected Person per iteration.
    - Need to check if loop is properly adding additional infected.
    - FIXED: for (auto state : states) changed to for (auto& state : states). Still having trouble understanding that pair has to be iterated by ref.

10. 2024-11-10 - Summary output too hard to read on screen.
    - FIXED: updated number of states output per line.
